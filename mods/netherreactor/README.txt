The Nether Reactor Mod

This mod adds in the Nether Reactor from the early days of Minecraft: Pocket Edition!

In order to use this mod, you'll need to craft a Nether Reactor core, which is as follows:


S = Steel
D = Diamond

SDS
SDS
SDS


Once done, you'll need to build the Nether Reactor, using four gold blocks, 13 cobblestone,
and of course the reactor core itself, as follows, from bottom to top:

S = Cobblestone
C = Core
G = Gold
# = Air

First layer:

GSG
SSS
GSG

Second Layer:
S#S
#C#
S#S

Top Layer:

#S#
SSS
#S#


To activate the Nether Reactor, right click the core after building the reactor - and away
it goes! From there, a Spire, Loot, and if mobs_skeleton is installed then Sword-Wielding
Skeletons will spawn to attack!

In every sense, this mod is mechanic-for-mechanic on par with the original. Meaning, if a
player is quick enough, they can mine up the gold from the reactor after starting it, and
breaking the reactor core while its running stops the whole thing and leaves behind Glowing
Obsidian!
